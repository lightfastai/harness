# Ralph Plan

You are operating in the autonomous Ralph planning loop. Each invocation, you do **exactly ONE step** based on the current state of `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, then **EXIT**. This keeps your context fresh across iterations.

## Step 0: Read State

1. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` completely
2. Read `thoughts/shared/specs/README.md` (story map, SLC slices, dependencies)
3. Determine which state you're in (see below)

## State Machine

### State A: Active plan where all phases are marked `[DONE]` → Housekeeping

The previous plan is complete (all `## Phase N: Title [DONE]`).

1. Move the `## Active` entry to `## Completed` in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Clear the `## Active` section
3. **Fall through** — continue to State B or C (housekeeping is lightweight, doesn't warrant its own iteration)

### State B: No `## Staging`, no `## Active` → Gap Analysis + Research

No work in progress. Figure out what's next.

1. **Check for completion**: If `## Unplanned Specs` is empty:
   - Spawn parallel subagents to verify each completed spec's acceptance criteria against the codebase
   - If ALL criteria satisfied → output `<done/>` and **EXIT**
   - If some unsatisfied → move those specs back to `## Unplanned Specs`

2. **Select next specs**: From Unplanned, following SLC slice order and dependencies from README.md
   - Select 1-3 related specs that form a coherent increment

3. **Research**: Spawn an Agent task that invokes `/research_codebase` via the Skill tool:

   ```
   /research_codebase autonomous: true
   What is the current implementation state for: [selected spec names]?
   Map existing code against acceptance criteria in [spec file paths].
   Identify what exists, what's missing, what partially exists.
   ```

   Wait for the task to complete.

4. **Write `## Staging` section** in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (insert between Active and Completed):

   ```
   ## Staging
   specs:
   - [spec path 1]
   - [spec path 2]
   research: [path to research document produced by step 3]
   ```

5. Remove selected specs from `## Unplanned Specs`
6. **EXIT** — next invocation sees Staging and creates the plan with fresh context

### State C: `## Staging` exists → Evaluate and Plan

Staging has specs and research. Time to decide: plan or research more?

1. **Read the research document** referenced in Staging's `research:` field

2. **Evaluate**: Does the research adequately cover the acceptance criteria in the staged specs?
   - Check: are all acceptance criteria from the spec files addressed in the research?
   - Check: does the research identify existing code, gaps, and partial implementations?

3. **If research is insufficient**:
   - Spawn another Agent task with `/research_codebase` targeting the specific gaps
   - Update the `research:` field in Staging to the new/supplementary document path
   - **EXIT** — come back next iteration to re-evaluate

4. **If research is sufficient** — create the plan:

   Spawn an Agent task that invokes `/create_plan` via the Skill tool:

   ```
   /create_plan autonomous: true
   Context: [research document path from Staging]
   Specs: [spec file paths from Staging]
   Plan the implementation to satisfy the acceptance criteria in the provided specs.
   Use the research document for current codebase understanding.
   ```

   Wait for the task to complete.

5. **Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**:
   - Remove the `## Staging` section entirely
   - Add to `## Active`:
     ```
     plan: [path to plan file created in step 4]
     specs:
     - [spec path 1]
     - [spec path 2]
     ```

6. **EXIT** — next invocation will be BUILD mode

## Spec Self-Correction

If during research or planning you discover spec inconsistencies:

- Fix the spec file directly
- Update thoughts/shared/specs/README.md if story map or dependencies changed
- Do NOT block — fix and proceed

## Rules

- **ONE heavy operation per invocation.** Research OR plan creation. Never both.
- Housekeeping and gap analysis are lightweight — combine with the next heavy step.
- Do NOT implement any code. Planning only.
- Do NOT commit. No code changes.
- Always delegate research to `/research_codebase` via Agent task
- Always delegate plan creation to `/create_plan` via Agent task
- Keep IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a concise index — detail lives in plan files

## Signals

| Signal                    | When                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `<done/>`                 | All specs fully satisfied (State B completion check) |
| `<blocked reason="..."/>` | Unresolvable issue requiring human intervention      |
| Normal exit               | Step completed, state updated for next invocation    |
